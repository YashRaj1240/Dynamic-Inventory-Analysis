## Overview

This project leverages **Power BI** to create a Dynamic Inventory Analysis dashboard that provides insights into inventory management, including stock levels, vendor performance, and demand forecasting. The dashboard uses ABC and XYZ classification to help prioritize inventory based on value and demand, supporting efficient inventory control and replenishment planning.

## Project Features

- **ABC and XYZ Classification**: Categorizes inventory into high-value (A), moderate-value (B), low-value (C), and demand variability (X, Y, Z) to optimize stock management strategies.
  
- **Vendor Analysis**: Highlights top vendors by inventory unit and value, helping to identify key suppliers and manage vendor performance.
  
- **Inventory Turnover and Reorder Point**: Tracks inventory turnover ratio and reorder points, ensuring timely stock replenishment and minimizing stockouts.

## Visualizations

The Power BI dashboard includes a variety of visualizations for effective inventory analysis, including:

- **Inventory Value and Unit Breakdown**: Pie charts showing inventory distribution by unit and value to help in identifying high-value items.
  
- **Top Vendors by Inventory Value**: Bar charts displaying the top suppliers, enabling targeted negotiations and performance evaluation.
  
- **ABC and XYZ Inventory Analysis**: Classification tables and visualizations that aid in prioritizing stock based on value and demand.
  
- **Revenue and Quantity Forecasting**: Line charts forecasting inventory needs, ensuring efficient inventory planning over upcoming periods.

## How to Use

1. **Optimize Inventory Management**: Use ABC and XYZ classification to prioritize inventory control measures based on item importance and demand variability.
  
2. **Monitor Vendor Performance**: Analyze top vendors by unit and value to manage supplier relationships and focus on critical suppliers.
  
3. **Forecast Demand**: Leverage revenue and quantity forecasting to anticipate inventory needs and prevent stock shortages or overstock.

## Requirements

- **Power BI Desktop**: Open the Power BI dashboard file in Power BI Desktop to interact with and explore the data.
